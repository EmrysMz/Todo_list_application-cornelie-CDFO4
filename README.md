# Todo_list_application-cornelie-CDFO4
A console based application to help keep track of tasks. You should be able to add, delete, complete tasks.
 I add to this more features explain at the end of the todo_application file like : 
 - Classify the importance of the task 
 - Give the status of the task 
 - Give a quick feedback of the task
